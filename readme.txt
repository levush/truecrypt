It feels to me that truecrypt has been taken over by the dark side.
In order to bless the world with the old, hopefully untainted sources
I started this repository to encourage you to further develop truecrypt.
Most important action item will be to insure that the core here is 
authentic. I guess it is, but I am not sure.

Also at least the windows version needs a screen keyboard to type the 
passphrase while the keys move every type like puzzle game. Also it needs
to use a low radiation "low pass" font to counter measure tempest attacks.
Because the one can be pretty sure, that a target's windows pc is infected 
with a keylogger. Even with linux one can not be sure, but it is less likely.

Thats all for the moment.

===============================================================================
Now for the kishkes:


Versions:
---
I am not sure, if both directories are the same, I will keep both for the
 moment. I rescued the linux version from kali linux sources (apt-get source)
and the windows version from http://fossies.org/windows/misc/

The windows version contains a visual studio sln file, the linux version does
not. So I keep both until I am wiser

Also I will add a manual I found on the internet on howto build the windows 
version

First steps will incluce building the windows version. (linux version, taken
from debian derivate kali will build)
