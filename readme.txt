If feels to me that truecrypt has been taken over by the dark side.
In order to bless the world with the old, hopefully untainted sources
I started this repository to encourage you to further develop truecrypt.
Most important action item will be to insure that the core here is 
authentic. I guess it is, but I am not sure.

Also at least the windows version needs a screen key board to type the 
passphrase where the keys move every type using a low radiation tempest
optimized font. Because the one can be pretty sure, that a target's 
windows pc is infected with a keylogger.

Thats all for the moment.

Versions:
---
I am not sure, if both directories are the same, but I rescued the linux version from kali linux sources (apt-get source)
and the windows version from http://fossies.org/windows/misc/

The windows version contains a visual studio sln file, the linux version does not. So I keep both until I am wiser.
